    <i>I’ve enjoyed getting my hands on new tech for as long as I can remember. Even when I was too young to understand which products had good specs or features, trying out new tech was always something I looked forward to. Though this did result in more than one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook">netbook</a> purchase when I was a teenager. Though I do like to try new things and tinker, I’ve consciously been trying to buy tech than I plan on keeping long-term. This resulted in a purchase of a 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro that I used for several years, and after ditching Android back in 2017, I used an iPhone SE for a while before settling into an iPhone 7 early last year. Sticking with these older products was partially an attempt to be a financially responsible adult. That’s what I told myself at least.</i>
